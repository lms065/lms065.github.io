							<h3>What is LaSCO?</h3>
							<h4>LaSCO stands for "Louisiana School Christian Organization"</h4>
						</hgroup>
						<p>We are a non-denominational Christian Club for the Louisiana School for Math, Science, and the Arts with the goal
						to bring Christian Students together every Monday night to have student led programs and bring students closer to god when 
						the burdens of this school attempt to pull us away from him. </p>
						&nbsp;
						<h3>When was LaSCO started?</h3>
							<p>LaSCO has basically existed since the school was opened whenever students started to feel pressurized from the different religious views that was pushed on them. They started LaSCO so that these students could get out of this pressure and be able to praise with fellow followers.</p>
						&nbsp;
						<h3>What is the purpose LaSCO wishes to fulfill?</h3>
							<p>LaSCO wishes that all those who come to the meetings are in a welcoming environment where it doesn't matter what denomination you are. Whatever denomination you are, you should expect inter-denomination meetings and programs.</p>
						&nbsp;
						<h3>What should you expect at a LaSCO meeting?</h3>
							<p>At a LaSCO function, you should expect a nice, laid-back atmosphere where you can hang out with other LSMSA students and some of the NSU students that work at the Wesley Campus Ministry where LaSCO meetings are held</p>
						&nbsp;
						<h3>Who is the sponsor of LaSCO?</h3>
							<p>Ms. Linda Gleason, one of the math teachers at LSMSA, is the official club sponsor of LaSCO, but there are other faculty members who are part of LaSCO who you can go to as well.</p>
